<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>

<p>This course serves as a refresher for linear algebra, calculus, and optimization. In addition, it will cover important topics meant to help you begin to acquire what is often called <em>mathematical maturity</em>.  It is designed to help prepare you mathematically for your fall courses.  This is an active-learning course.  Lecture notes will be posted online.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="course-learning-goals">Course Learning Goals</h3>

<p><strong>At the end of this course, students should be able to</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Understand and have working knowledge of mathematics used in Master’s-level economics.  Students will learn/review calculus of one variable and of several variables, linear algebra and optimization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><strong>The following will address this outcome</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Assigned readings and problem set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This outcome will be evaluated primarily by</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Completion of problem set and exam.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h3 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>

<p>The book used for this course will be Simon &amp; Blume’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Economists-Carl-P-Simon/dp/0393957330/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458096199&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Mathematics+for+economics+blume" title="Mathematics for Economists">“<em>Mathematics for Economists</em>”</a>.</p>

<h4 id="workload">Workload</h4>

<p>It is WSU policy that for every hour of faculty directed activities, students should expect a minimum of two hours engaged in supportive learning activities.  Depending on your skills and knowledge as a learner, additional time may be required.</p>

<p>In this course, there will be no official “faculty directed time” and the workload will in all honesty be substantial for all individuals that have not had a significant amount of prior mathematics education.</p>

<h4 id="assignments">Assignments</h4>

<p>An assignment will be posted on the course website.  Due dates are given below.  <font color="red">**The assignment should be submitted to my box or my email by 11:59 pm Pacific Standard Time on the due date**</font>.  Note that if you are going to turn your assignment into my box, do so before 5:00 pm as the office will lock the room that has the boxes at that time.  The assignment will be worth 30/100 points.  The assignment will be a problem set that gives the students practice applying the mathematical tools covered in the course text.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="late-assignments">Late assignments</h4>

<p>Although I do prefer that you turn in your assignment on time, I will accept the assignment past its due date. Turning in the assignment late will not affect your grade. That being said, I strongly encourage you to adhere to the course schedule listed below so that you don’t fall behind.</p>

<h4 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h4>

<p>There will be one exam at the end of the course and it is worth 70/100 points.  The exam will cover all the material covered in the course.  The exam will be proctored on campus in Hulbert Hall on a date TBA.</p>
