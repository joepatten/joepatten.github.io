I"É<p>Despite all the stress and anxiety that came with the job market and finishing up my dissertation, I enjoyed the experience (although I wouldn‚Äôt want to ever go through it again). I had to make some very difficult decisions during this time as I wanted the best for my family, but also wanted the most stimulating and rewarding job experience possible. An issue that I ran into is that academic job hunting and industry job hunting does not typically happen in the same timeframe (at least the industry jobs I wanted). The economic job market starts in fall, and typically interviews are held in January (during a big conference). Most jobs are academic and research jobs, with only a somewhat small proportion of jobs being truly ‚Äúindustry‚Äù jobs. As I was fairly certain I did not want to go into academia, I only applied to a small percentage of jobs in the official job market that at the very least mildly intersted me. My plan was to see what offers came in, evaluate them, and if I did not like any of them, wait a few months to apply to industry (mostly data science) jobs.</p>

<p>I felt fairly lucky with my applications as I was able snag a good amount of interviews. A big chunk of my interviews were consulting firms. Although each firm had a different focus or different type of work available, the common theme I saw was that the work-life balance at most of these consulting firms was not great. After a few interviews with some firms, I quickly lost interest. Similarly, there were a few companies (not naming any names) that had reputations of poor work-life balances, so I eventually lost interest with these companies. I also had a few interviews with a number of government agencies (like the Census Bureau and the FDA). A lot of the work that was being done at these agencies was super intriguing, but for the most part, I did not see myself working at any particular one.</p>
