<p>I am a PhD Economist and Data Scientist. My wife Lynn and I have four children: Kate, Emma, Danny, and Matty. Lynn and I are both from California. We met each other at BYU where I was studying Biomechanics and she was studying Human Development. We got married our senior year. After graduating from BYU, I stayed to do Biomechanics research and TA for the Biomechanics courses. While there, I took some Economics courses on the side and quickly fell in love with the subject. Since then, we have lived in various states, including Washington, Arizona, Texas, and now Virginia.</p>

<p>In addition to Economics, I love doing the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Playing with my kids (sledding, hide and seek, and playing any kind of sport)</li>
  <li>Going on dates or just spending time with the wife</li>
  <li>Playing and coaching soccer</li>
  <li>Programming in Python</li>
  <li>Applying Machine Learning models to everyday problems</li>
  <li>Working in Photoshop</li>
  <li>Playing and creating video games (when I acutally have some time)</li>
</ul>
