I am a 4th year Economics PhD student at WSU. Above is picture of me, my wife Lynn, and two of our kids, Kate and Emma. Lynn and I are both from California. We met each other at BYU where I was studying Biomechanics and she was studying Human Development. We got married our senior year. After graduating from BYU, I stayed to do Biomechanics research and TA for Biomechanics courses. While there, I took some Economics courses on the side and quickly fell in love with the subject. Since then, we have lived in various states, including Washington, Arizona, and Texas. I started at WSU in 2016, and we have had a blast here.

In addition to Economics, I love doing the following things:
- Playing with my kids (sledding, hide and seek, and playing any kind of sport are particularly fun)
- Going on dates or just spending time with the wife
- Playing soccer
- Programming in Python
- Working in Photoshop
- Playing and creating video games (when I acutally have some time)
