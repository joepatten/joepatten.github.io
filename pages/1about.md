I am a 3rd Economics PhD student at WSU. Above is picture of me, my wife Lynn, and two of our kids, Kate and Emma. Lynn and I are both from California. We met each other at BYU where I was studying Biomechanics and she was studying Human Development. We got married our senior year. After graduating from BYU, I stayed to do Biomechanics research and TA for Biomechanics courses. While there, I took some Economics courses and quickly fell in love with the subject. Since then, we have lived in various states, including Washington, Arizona, and Texas.

In addition to Economics, I love programming in Python. I also love working in Photoshop
