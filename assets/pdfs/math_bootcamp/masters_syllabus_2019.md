### Class Website
Go to my [website](http://joepatten.com/teaching/masters_math_bootcamp_2019).

### Course Description

This course serves as a refresher for linear algebra, calculus, and optimization. In addition, it will cover important topics meant to help you begin to acquire what is often called *mathematical maturity*.  It is designed to help prepare you mathematically for your fall courses.  This is an active-learning course.  Lecture notes will be posted online.

### Course Learning Goals

**At the end of this course, students should be able to**:
>Understand and have working knowledge of mathematics used in Master's-level economics.  Students will learn/review calculus of one variable and of several variables, linear algebra and optimization.  

**The following will address this outcome**:
> Assigned readings and problem set.

**This outcome will be evaluated primarily by**:
> Completion of problem set and exam.

### Grading, Exams, and Homework 
Grading will be based off points accumulated through an assignment and exam.

| Course Items | Due Date | Points |
| :---   | :---  | :---:  |
| Assignment 1 | August 8 | 30 |
| Final Exam | TBA (August 12-16) | 70 |
| **Total** | | **100** |

#### Workload

It is WSU policy that for every hour of faculty directed activities, students should expect a minimum of two hours engaged in supportive learning activities.  Depending on your skills and knowledge as a learner, additional time may be required.

In this course, there will be no official "faculty directed time" and the workload will in all honesty be substantial for all individuals that have not had a significant amount of prior mathematics education.

#### Assignments

An assignment will be posted on the course website.  Due dates are given below.  <font color="red">**The assignment should be submitted to my box or my email by 11:59 pm Pacific Standard Time on the due date**</font>.  Note that if you are going to turn your assignment into my box, do so before 5:00 pm as the office will lock the room that has the boxes at that time.  The assignment will be worth 30/100 points.  The assignment will be a problem set that gives the students practice applying the mathematical tools covered in the course text.

#### Late assignments

Although I do prefer that you turn in your assignment on time, I will accept the assignment past its due date. Turning in the assignment late will not affect your grade. That being said, I strongly encourage you to adhere to the course schedule listed below so that you don't fall behind. 

#### Final Exam

There will be one exam at the end of the course and it is worth 70/100 points.  The exam will cover all the material covered in the course.  The exam will be proctored on campus in Hulbert Hall on a date TBA.
